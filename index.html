            </h1>
            <p>
                Since 2004, KAYAK has been a trailblazer in the travel industry, introducing meta search for travel and
                processing billions of queries annually. The platform aggregates information from hundreds of travel
                sites, providing users with a comprehensive view of flights, hotels, rental cars, and vacation packages.
                From a small team of 14, KAYAK has grown into a company with over 1,000 travel enthusiasts
                operating across 7 international brands. Acquired by Booking Holdings in 2013, KAYAK continues
                to lead in online travel, making it easier for millions of travelers worldwide to confidently explore the
                world.

            <p>
                At KAYAK, the mission is to simplify hotel searches, providing users with the information they need
                to make confident booking decisions. Here’s an overview of how KAYAK’s hotel services function:
                <span class="header2">• Search and Compare:</span>
                Conducting a simple search on KAYAK allows users to scan prices across numerous hotel booking
                sites. Users can compare options for the same hotel and choose where to book, whether directly
                with the hotel or through another platform.
                <span class="header2">• Fee-Free Booking:</span>
                Hotel prices come directly from the booking sites to the user’s screen, with no extra fees from
                KAYAK. The service is entirely free for users, as hotels pay KAYAK when users are redirected
                to their sites.
                <span class="header2">• Advertisement Display:</span>
                Travel-related advertisements may be displayed on KAYAK’s site, with some companies compensating KAYAK for user clicks.

                Kayak Recommendations
            </h1>
            <p>
                <span class="header2">1. Recommended Sorting:</span>
                Default sorting is based on KAYAK’s ’Recommended’ algorithm,
                considering parameters like price, guest ratings, and popularity. KAYAK also factors in the
                average revenue potential from each hotel result.
                <span class="header2">2. Sorting Options:</span>
                Users can tailor their search with filters and sorting options such as price,
                hotel class, review score, and distance.
                <span class="header2">3. Provider Visibility:</span>
                The same deal may be available on several provider sites, all visible for user
                selection. KAYAK may highlight one main provider based on factors like customer popularity,
                ratings, or payments.
                <span class="header2">4. Price Sorting:</span>
                A ’Price’ sort provides quick access to the cheapest and/or most expensive hotel
                deals.
